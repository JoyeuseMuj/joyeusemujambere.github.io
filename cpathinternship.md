## Overview

Intern at the [Critical Path Institute](https://c-path.org/), a biomedical non-profit that is a public/private partnership that works to advance drug discovery for rare and underserved diseases. Served as an inern in the Data Science Team in the Data Collaboration Center from June 2023 - August 2024, under the supervision of Dr. Nicole Vasilevsky.

**Description**: Reported on a workshop held at the Biocuration Conferencein Padua, Italy in April 2023. The report describes the Careers Workshop which discussed relevant skill sets for biocurators, how to tailor a resume or curriculum vitae (CV) for finding a position or for career progression, as well as tips for recruitment.

__Ontology Training__

An ontology is a branch of metaphysics that studies the nature of being. Can also be refer to a formal description of knowledge as a set of consepts and relationships within a domain. 

Did [OBO Academy ontology training](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/pathways/early-career-data-scientist/#6-introduction-to-ontologies) 

__Mapping of Rare Epilepsy Patient Data to Disease and Phenotype Ontologies__

The Rare Epilepsy Network (REN) which connects over 125+ Rare Epilespy Organizations to promote awareness and advocacy. 

Website: [https://www.rareepilepsynetwork.org/](https://www.rareepilepsynetwork.org/) 

In order to make the data from the REN more discoverable and interoperable with other datasets, we mapped the survey questions to disease or phenotype terms from biomedical ontologies.  

The Mondo Disease Ontology is a semi-automatically constructed ontology that merges in multiple disease resources to yeild a coherent merged ontology.

Website: [https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/)

The Human Phenotype Ontology is a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease.

Website: [https://hpo.jax.org/](https://hpo.jax.org/)

The annotated data will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledge Graph and made available via the Rare Disease Cures Accelerator and Data and Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP) to researchers and clinicians to reuse the data to advance drug discovery. 

__Mapping of Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) to Phenotype Ontologies__

A clinical outcome assessment (COA) is the patient assesment used in an endpoint and provides a rating that is intended to represent some aspect of a patient's health status.

To enhance the findability of relevant COAs for clinical trials, we annotated COAs in the C-Path COA Resource to ontology terms.
